# NYC_Airbnb_Data-Analysis_Python

I have created a full Data Analysis project on Airbnb NYC dataset using Python only.

**Airbnb_DataAnalysis.ipynb** is the python file where all codes will be found. 

All stages are present: 
1. Data Collection (Reading data from CSV file)
2. Data Cleaning and Data Preprocessing (Cleaning all null and missing value, sorting values and changing datatypes)
3. EDA 
4. Data Visualization

**Airbnb_Open_Data.csv** is the file used as dataset.

**cleaned_dataset.csv** is the final cleaned dataset file which has been used for EDA and visualization.

**pdf_dataanalysis.pdf** can be used to look into the overall output along with codes in one file.
